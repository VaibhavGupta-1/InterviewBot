## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest stable version)
- JDK 17 or higher

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio.**

3.  **Add Your Groq API Key:**
    - In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `local.properties`.
    - Inside `local.properties`, add the following line, replacing `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key from the Groq Console:
      ```properties
      GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
      ```
    - The project's `.gitignore` file is already configured to keep this file private, so you won't accidentally commit your secret key.

4.  **Sync Gradle and Run:**
    - Let Android Studio sync the project's Gradle files.
    - Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
